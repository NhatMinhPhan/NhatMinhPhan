Greetings, I’m Nhat Minh Phan *(he/him)*, and welcome to my GitHub profile.

Currently, I'm a computer science major at York University. So far, I can somewhat manage Python, Java and some JavaScript/HTML programs.
I'm looking forward to find more opportunities and ideas to put what I have learned so far in my major into practice.

In addition, here is my *[résumé](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VM3fpzQGeNF_q_rudWY1ih9LyVOZaWPc/view?usp=sharing)* which outlines my current entire body of work.
