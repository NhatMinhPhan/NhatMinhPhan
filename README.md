Greetings, I’m Nhat Minh Phan *(he/him)*, and welcome to my GitHub profile.

Currently, I'm a computer science major at York University. So far, I can somewhat manage Python, Java and some JavaScript/HTML programs.
I'm looking forward to find more opportunities and ideas to put what I have learned so far in my major into practice.

In addition, here is my *[résumé](https://github.com/NhatMinhPhan/NhatMinhPhan/blob/db39d7b2867b1cf8b17fd52c8c09c8f5d38c1ebc/Nhat%20Minh%20Phan's%20CS%20Resume.pdf)* which outlines my current entire body of work and skills relating to computing.
